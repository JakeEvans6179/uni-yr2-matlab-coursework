Energy conversion and supply coursework using MATLAB Simulink and FEMM

Part 1 constists of simulating and analysing and AC power system covering power generation, transmission, distribution and load. This section uses simulink.

Part 2 consists of simulating and analysing DC/AC and AC/DC conversion using inverters and rectifiers. This section uses simulink

Part 3 consists of numerical modelling and simulation of linear and non linear ferromagnetic actuator using FEA techniques as well as analytical methods. This section uses FEMM to model linear ferromagnetic actuator and simulate its electromagnetic characteristics, building analytical (numerical) model for linear FA, calculating inductance using FEA technique and analytical method and calculating electromagnetic force using energy method.

Part 4 consists of building analytical models of DC machines and evaluating steady and transient state characterists, using simulink to model a brushed permanent magnet DC machine, modelling field wound DC machines and simulating it's performance as well as analysing, comparing and analysisng charactistics and output performance of DC machines.
